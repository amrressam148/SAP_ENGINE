We are thrilled to have you on the team. This guide will help you get started during your first week.

## Your First Day Checklist

1.  **IT Setup:** Your first priority is to get your laptop and accounts set up. Please contact the IT Helpdesk via the internal portal to get your credentials.
2.  **Manager Sync:** Schedule a 30-minute introductory call with your direct manager to discuss your role and 30/60/90 day plan.
3.  **Team Intro:** Your manager will introduce you to the Product Excellence team and your assigned "buddy" who will help you with any questions.

## Essential Tools

* **Confluence:** This is our primary source of truth for all documentation, processes, and team information. Please bookmark our team space.
* **SharePoint:** Used for official document storage and cross-departmental files.
* **Productboard:** This is the tool we use for roadmapping and collecting customer insights.
* **Slack:** Our main communication tool for daily stand-ups and quick chats.

## Compliance Training

All new employees must complete the mandatory 'Data Privacy and Security' training within their first 5 days. You will find this assigned to you on the internal learning portal.
