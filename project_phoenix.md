## Project Overview

Project Phoenix is the internal code-name for our next-generation, generative AI-powered process agent. This is a strategic bet to leapfrog competitors.

## Core Capabilities (Phase 1)

* **Automated Insight:** Phoenix will proactively analyze a customer's entire process map repository and automatically suggest optimizations, identify bottlenecks, and flag compliance risks.
* **Natural Language Interaction:** Users will be able to "chat" with their process maps, asking questions like "Which process is most expensive?" or "Show me all processes that involve the finance department."

## Technology Stack (Proposed)

* **LLM:** We are evaluating a self-hosted `LLaMA 3` model (70B) for maximum data privacy.
* **Vector Database:** Evaluating Pinecone vs. a self-managed ChromaDB instance.
* **Deployment:** The service will be hosted on SAP's internal cloud infrastructure (Gardener).

## Timeline

* **Q4 2025:** Initial prototype development (Alpha).
* **Q1 2026:** Internal Beta testing with 3 selected design partners.
* **Q2 2026:** Target for public announcement.

**Again: This information is strictly confidential.**
