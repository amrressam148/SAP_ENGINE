# Product Roadmapping Process (Updated Q4 2025)

This document outlines the standard process for quarterly roadmapping at SAP Signavio. Our goal is to maintain transparency, align with strategic goals, and be data-driven.

## Guiding Principles

* **Customer-Centric:** All roadmap items must be tied to a validated customer problem or insight.
* **Aligned:** Features must align with our high-level company OKRs (Objectives and Key Results).
* **Data-Informed:** Decisions should be backed by data from Pendo, customer feedback channels, and market analysis.

## The Quarterly Cycle

1.  **Week 1-3 (Insight Gathering):** Product Managers (PMs) gather and synthesize new insights from customer feedback, sales, and analytics. All new insights must be logged in Productboard.
2.  **Week 4 (Prioritization):** PMs use the RICE framework (Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort) to score potential features within Productboard.
3.  **Week 5 (Drafting):** PMs create their draft roadmaps and review them with their "Empowered Product Trio" (PM, Lead Engineer, Designer).
4.  **Week 6 (Alignment Review):** All PMs present their draft roadmaps to the Product Excellence team and leadership for cross-team alignment and to identify dependencies.
5.  **Week 7 (Finalization):** Roadmaps are finalized, locked in Productboard, and communicated to the wider organization.

## Tooling

* **Productboard:** The *single source of truth* for all roadmap items and prioritization.
* **Confluence:** Used to document the *reasoning* and *strategy* behind roadmap decisions.
